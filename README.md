# binary-to-hex
Change binary to hexadecimal and change endianness.

Make a .txt file and write the binary values.
Example:

     00000000000000000000000000000000
     00000000000000000000000000000000
     00000000000000000000000000000000
     00000000000000000000000000000000     

Run the script by opening it in a cmd window
Copy the path to the .txt file
Paste in the cmd window
Two .txt files will be made in the same location as the original txt.
